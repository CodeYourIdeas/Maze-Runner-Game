# Maze-Runner-Game-in-Python-Using-the-Pygame-module-
This is basically an interactive maze runner game built using the Pygame module available in the python programming language which is an open source library used to build 2-D games. What I tried is to clone the T-Rex game available offline in the Google Chrome web browser.
